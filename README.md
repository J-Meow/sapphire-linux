# Sapphire for Linux
A Matrix client for linux

For [Summer of Making 2025](https://summer.hackclub.com/), a [Matrix](https://matrix.org) (chat service, extremely cool) client for Linux.
This will be a challenge as I have never made a native GUI linux app.

There are many out there already but it's fun to code so yay and now bye
