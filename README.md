# Sapphire for Linux
A Matrix client for linux

For [Summer of Making 2025](https://summer.hackclub.com/), a [Matrix](https://matrix.org) (chat service, extremely cool) client for Linux.
This will be a challenge as I have never made a native GUI linux app.

There are many out there already but it's fun to code so i'm doing it anyway

Technically works on Mac but I'm going to make one specifically for Apple devices at some point.

`./compile.sh` to compile it, `./sapphire-linux` to run it.

If the shell script doesn't run do `chmod +x compile.sh` and it should work next time you run it.
